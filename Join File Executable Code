#for the join_file function, input your file1 is arg1, file2 as arg2, merge_column_name as arg3, and jointype as arg4
#file1: acts as your lefthand file
#file2: acts as your righthand file
#merge_column_name: it's the column you want to merge all the data relative to (ex. Compound ID)
#jointype: can be left, right, inner, or outer

#IMPORTANT: DO NOT enter file1, file2, merge_column_name, and jointype with '' surrounding them! The function will not work.
